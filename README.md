Project 2: Cave Explorer
Team: JVJ = Jalen Jackson, Victoria Tran, Justin Castillo

## Intro
This project uses a Breadth-First Search algorithm to find the pathway to a desired destination in a cave. The specific cave used for this project has a mouth at (16,0,0), has limitations (16,7,9) and a destination of (8,1,7).
